If you want to load the environnement variables in a `python file`, import them like so

```


## Utils
### SQLConnection

```python
from satellitecrops.utils.sql_connector import SQLConnection

# Instanciate connector object
conn = SQLConnection()

# Write SQL query
# This is a test query for getting first row of db
query = """
  SELECT * FROM parcelles_graphiques LIMIT 1
"""

# Send request and store result in res variable
res = conn.select(query)

```

## Satellite images from Sentinel2 
- Description of data: Satellite documents used are *Sentinel-2 Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs*. Each satellite view (a certain location at a certain date) is stored as a folder containing images from different spectral bandwidths and a description file.
- How to get it: [Element 84 search API](https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1/search) returns as results, a list of URLs to satellite documents corresponding to the query. The satellite documents are then downloaded directly in a Google Bucket.
